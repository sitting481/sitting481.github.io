title: About Me
---

I am a student majoring in Software Engineering, with a focus on software development, data science, and AI applications. During my internship at Zhonger Software Co., Ltd., I contributed to the development of a bus ticketing management database system, where I was responsible for ensuring data consistency through transaction mechanisms. At Foshan Automobile Transportation Group, I designed a segmented path-planning algorithm to overcome waypoint limitations in map APIs, thereby enhancing system performance. Due to confidentiality agreements with the companies, certain project details cannot be publicly disclosed, but I welcome further discussion and communication regarding my work.

In addition, I document some of my recently completed projects on my personal blog. Although these projects are relatively small in scale, they have allowed me to continuously improve my technical implementation and problem-solving skills through hands-on practice. I genuinely look forward to any feedback or guidance you may offer.
