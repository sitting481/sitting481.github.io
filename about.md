title: About Me
---

I am a student majoring in Software Engineering, and I am passionate about exploring the fields of software development, data analysis, data science, as well as various application scenarios of artificial intelligence. My passion stems from the fact that these fields can translate technology into practical value: software development enables the gradual building of functional systems within controllable technical frameworks, creating practical value for users; data analysis can extract insights for decision-making from massive datasets, providing scientific support for human decision-making; and artificial intelligence can break through the limitations of human capabilities, further optimize service efficiency, and undertake high-risk tasks that are difficult for humans to perform. I hope to utilize the technical capabilities in these fields to develop practical technical solutions, effectively improve work efficiency, and meet practical needs.

During my internship at Zhonger Software Co., Ltd., I contributed to the development of a bus ticketing management database system, where I was responsible for ensuring data consistency through transaction mechanisms. At Foshan Automobile Transportation Group, I designed a segmented path-planning algorithm to overcome waypoint limitations in map APIs, thereby enhancing system performance. Due to confidentiality agreements with the companies, certain project details cannot be publicly disclosed, but I welcome further discussion and communication regarding my work.

In addition, I document some of my recently completed projects on my personal blog. Although these projects are relatively small in scale, they have allowed me to continuously improve my technical implementation and problem-solving skills through hands-on practice. I genuinely look forward to any feedback or guidance you may offer.
